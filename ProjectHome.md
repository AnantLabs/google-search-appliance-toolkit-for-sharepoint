## Deprecated: ##
This tool is now superseded by Google's Official product: Google Search Box For Sharepoint.  This can be found at:
http://code.google.com/apis/searchappliance/documentation/connectors/200/connector_admin/searchbox_sharepoint.html



## Tool #1: ##
**Onebox** for **Sharepoint BDC** (MOSS 2007). Do you have a backend application connected to Sharepoint? Do you have a Business Data Catalog defined inside Sharepoint? Would you like to make it available to GSA as a Onebox provider? This is it! For instructions, read default.htm.



## Tool #2: ##
Googley Control:   A **Sharepoint search** [![](http://google-search-appliance-toolkit-for-sharepoint.googlecode.com/files/dropdown_scope.jpg)](webpart.md) some modified Search Pages, and a few other bits to integrate the GSA into your normal Sharepoint Search Framework.   Using this you will be able to submit searches from the normal WSS 3.0 search boxes to the GSA.   The GSA can then be configured to crawl the Sharepoint stores, any other filetypes, etc. to make it a 'universal' search box.

**UPDATE:**  Added revisions to the Googley Control (See downloads and Wiki)
